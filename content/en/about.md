## Summary

Technology professional with a solid background in Systems Analysis and Development and practical experience in building web applications and automation. My foundation includes Front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap), Backend (PHP, Python), and a Fullstack project in the JavaScript ecosystem (Vue.js, Node.js), in addition to strong database proficiency (SQL). I am now strategically transitioning to consolidate myself as a Fullstack Developer, focusing on Java Web for Backend (including knowledge acquired in a specific discipline and deepening in modern frameworks like Quarkus). I seek a challenging position that allows me to continuously evolve, applying my analytical profile and problem-solving ability.
